        "Following on Exercise #2, let's do the same thing, but this time we will try different values for the proportion of the population that is actually infected. What you should notice is that the PROPORTION INFECTED GIVEN A POSITIVE TEST depends (a lot!) on the OVERALL RATE OF INFECTION. Put another way, to determine the probabilty of a hypothesis, given your data (e.g., proportion infected given a positive test), you have to know the probability that the hypothesis was true without any data.\n",
        "Why is this the case? It is a simple consequence of the definition of a conditional probability, formulated as Bayes' Rule. Specifically, the joint probability of two events, call them A and B, is defined as:\n",
        "𝑝(𝐴𝑎𝑛𝑑𝐵)=𝑝(𝐴)×𝑝(𝐵|𝐴)\n",
